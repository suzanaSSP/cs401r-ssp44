# Task B3 - Remote State.
#
# Copy this file to backend.tf. scripts/bootstrap-state.sh creates the state
# bucket and lock table and replaces 042186225029 below with your real
# account ID (it also copies this file to backend.tf for you if you have not).
# The bucket must exist BEFORE terraform init: a backend cannot bootstrap the
# bucket that stores its own state.
